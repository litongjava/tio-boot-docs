## 余弦相似度与余弦距离

### 什么是余弦相似度

余弦相似度用于衡量两个向量之间的相似程度。具体来说：

- **余弦相似度为 1**：表示两个向量完全相同。
- **余弦相似度为 0**：表示两个向量正交（没有相似性）。
- **余弦相似度为 -1**：表示两个向量完全相反。

注意：在 pgvector 扩展中，运算符 `<=>` 实际上计算的是**余弦距离**，定义为  
\[
\text{cosine_distance} = 1 - \text{cosine_similarity}
\]
因此：

- 当余弦相似度为 1 时，余弦距离为 0；
- 当余弦相似度为 0 时，余弦距离为 1；
- 当余弦相似度为 -1 时，余弦距离为 2。

### 余弦相似度公式

余弦相似度的数学定义为：
\[
\text{cosine_similarity} = \frac{\vec{A} \cdot \vec{B}}{\|\vec{A}\| \|\vec{B}\|}
\]
其中：

- \(\vec{A} \cdot \vec{B}\) 为向量点积
- \(\|\vec{A}\|\) 和 \(\|\vec{B}\|\) 为向量的范数

## 使用 PostgreSQL 和 `pgvector` 扩展来计算向量相似度

在 PostgreSQL 中，使用 `pgvector` 扩展可以方便地存储向量并计算向量之间的相似度或距离。

### 1. 安装 `pgvector` 扩展

确保已安装该扩展：

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
```

```sql
-- 欧氏距离 0, 两个向量完全相同，距离自是 0
SELECT '[1, 2, 3]' <=> '[1, 2, 3]' AS similarity;
-- 两个向量的内积 -14
SELECT '[1, 2, 3]' <#> '[1, 2, 3]' AS similarity;
```

### 2. 创建表并存储向量

下面创建一个示例表，假设向量维度为 3：

```sql
CREATE TABLE embeddings (
    id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    embedding vector(3)
);
```

插入示例数据：

```sql
INSERT INTO embeddings (embedding) VALUES
    ('[1, 2, 3]'),
    ('[4, 5, 6]');
```

### 3. 计算向量距离与相似度

**（1）使用 `<=>` 计算余弦距离**

下面查询计算向量 `[1, 2, 3]` 与表中向量之间的余弦距离（注意：值越小表示越相似）：

```sql
SELECT
    id,
    embedding,
    (embedding <=> '[1, 2, 3]') AS cosine_distance
FROM
    embeddings
ORDER BY
    cosine_distance ASC;
```

**（2）计算余弦相似度**

如果需要得到余弦相似度，则可用公式 `cosine_similarity = 1 - cosine_distance`：

```sql
WITH input_vector AS (
    SELECT '[1, 2, 3]'::vector(3) AS embedding
)
SELECT
    e.id,
    e.embedding,
    (1 - (e.embedding <=> iv.embedding)) AS cosine_similarity
FROM
    embeddings e,
    input_vector iv
ORDER BY
    cosine_similarity DESC;
```

在这个示例中：

- `e.embedding <=> iv.embedding` 得到的是余弦距离；
- `1 - (e.embedding <=> iv.embedding)` 则转换为余弦相似度（值越大越相似）。

## professors 向量化和查询示例

假设有一张教授信息表，需要为姓名、描述和备注添加向量字段（维度 1536），并进行相似度查询。

### 1. 修改表结构添加向量字段

```sql
CREATE TABLE rumi_sjsu_professors(
  id BIGINT NOT NULL,
  name VARCHAR(256),
  department VARCHAR(256),
  job_title VARCHAR(256),
  email VARCHAR(256),
  description TEXT,
  files JSON,
  remark VARCHAR(256),
  name_vector VECTOR(1536),
  description_vector VECTOR(1536),
  remark_vector VECTOR(1536),
  vectors_completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  creator VARCHAR(64) DEFAULT '',
  create_time TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updater VARCHAR(64) DEFAULT '',
  update_time TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  deleted SMALLINT DEFAULT 0,
  tenant_id BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
```

### 2. 数据插入示例

下面是插入包含向量数据的示例语句：

```sql
-- 示例1
INSERT INTO rumi_sjsu_professors (
  id, name, department, job_title, email, description, files, remark, name_vector, description_vector, remark_vector, vectors_completed
) VALUES (
  1,
  'Dr. John Doe',
  'Computer Science',
  'Professor',
  'jdoe@sjsu.edu',
  'Expert in artificial intelligence and machine learning.',
  '{"resume": "link_to_resume.pdf"}',
  'Well-known researcher',
  '[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...]',  -- 1536维向量
  '[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...]',  -- 1536维向量
  '[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...]',  -- 1536维向量
  TRUE
);

-- 示例2
INSERT INTO rumi_sjsu_professors (
  id, name, department, job_title, email, description, files, remark, name_vector, description_vector, remark_vector, vectors_completed
) VALUES (
  2,
  'Dr. Jane Smith',
  'Mathematics',
  'Associate Professor',
  'jsmith@sjsu.edu',
  'Specializes in algebraic topology and number theory.',
  '{"cv": "link_to_cv.pdf"}',
  'Renowned academic',
  '[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...]',
  '[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...]',
  '[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...]',
  TRUE
);

-- 示例3
INSERT INTO rumi_sjsu_professors (
  id, name, department, job_title, email, description, files, remark, name_vector, description_vector, remark_vector, vectors_completed
) VALUES (
  3,
  'Dr. Emily Zhang',
  'Physics',
  'Assistant Professor',
  'ezhang@sjsu.edu',
  'Researcher in quantum mechanics and particle physics.',
  '{"portfolio": "link_to_portfolio.pdf"}',
  'Emerging scientist',
  '[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...]',
  '[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...]',
  '[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...]',
  TRUE
);
```

### 3. 计算相似度的 SQL 查询

假设我们希望计算输入向量与三个向量字段的余弦相似度（需转换为 `1 - (<=>)`）并检索相似度最高的三条记录，可按如下方式查询：

```sql
SELECT
  id,
  name,
  department,
  job_title,
  email,
  description,
  remark,
  (1 - (name_vector <=> input_vector)) AS name_similarity,
  (1 - (description_vector <=> input_vector)) AS description_similarity,
  (1 - (remark_vector <=> input_vector)) AS remark_similarity
FROM
  rumi_sjsu_professors,
  LATERAL (
    VALUES (
      ARRAY[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...]::VECTOR(1536)  -- 替换为实际输入向量
    )
  ) AS input(input_vector)
ORDER BY
  GREATEST(
    1 - (name_vector <=> input_vector),
    1 - (description_vector <=> input_vector),
    1 - (remark_vector <=> input_vector)
  ) DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

**说明：**

- 在 SELECT 子句中，我们分别计算三个字段的余弦相似度；
- ORDER BY 中使用了 `GREATEST(...) DESC`，确保返回的记录中至少有一个字段的相似度最高；
- 如果需要在 WHERE 子句中过滤出相似度较高的记录，不能直接引用 SELECT 的别名，而需要重新计算。例如：

```sql
SELECT
  id,
  name,
  department,
  job_title,
  email,
  description,
  remark,
  (1 - (name_vector <=> input_vector)) AS name_similarity,
  (1 - (description_vector <=> input_vector)) AS description_similarity,
  (1 - (remark_vector <=> input_vector)) AS remark_similarity
FROM
  rumi_sjsu_professors,
  LATERAL (
    VALUES (
      ARRAY[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...]::VECTOR(1536)  -- 替换为实际输入向量
    )
  ) AS input(input_vector)
WHERE
  (1 - (name_vector <=> input_vector)) > 0.9
  OR (1 - (description_vector <=> input_vector)) > 0.9
  OR (1 - (remark_vector <=> input_vector)) > 0.9
ORDER BY
  GREATEST(
    1 - (name_vector <=> input_vector),
    1 - (description_vector <=> input_vector),
    1 - (remark_vector <=> input_vector)
  ) DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

### 4. <#> and <=>

在 pgvector 扩展中，提供了不同的距离（或相似度）运算符，它们对应不同的度量方式。具体来说：

1. **`<#>` 运算符（余弦距离）**

   - **计算内容：** 它计算的是余弦距离，定义为
     \[
     \text{cosine_distance}(v,w)=1-\frac{v\cdot w}{\|v\|\|w\|}
     \]
     也就是 1 减去余弦相似度。
   - **取值范围：** 余弦相似度的取值范围为 \([-1,1]\)，因此余弦距离的范围为 \([0,2]\)
     - 当两个向量方向完全一致时，余弦相似度为 1，对应余弦距离 0；
     - 当两个向量方向完全相反时，余弦相似度为 –1，对应余弦距离 2。
   - **读法：** 读作“余弦距离”。

2. **`<=>` 运算符（内积距离）**
   - **计算内容：** 它计算的是内积距离，通常定义为负的内积：
     \[
     \text{inner_product_distance}(v,w) = - (v\cdot w)
     \]
     这样设计的目的是使得相似（内积较大）的向量其“距离”较小。
   - **取值范围：** 内积本身没有固定的上下界（除非向量做了归一化处理），因此：
     - 若向量未经归一化，其内积可能为任意实数，所以内积距离理论上取值范围为 \((-\infty,\,+\infty)\)；
     - 若向量都做了单位归一化，那么内积的范围就是 \([-1,1]\)，对应的内积距离范围为 \([-1,1]\)。
   - **读法：** 读作“内积距离”。

总结一下：

- **`<#>`：** 计算余弦距离，范围 [0, 2]，读作“余弦距离”。
- **`<=>`：** 计算内积距离（即负内积），范围取决于向量是否归一化，未归一化时理论上无界，读作“内积距离”。

## 使用代码操作向量数据库

### 1. 使用代码插入数据

如何使用代码代替上面的 INSERT INTO rumi_sjsu_professors 语句

```java

插入其他的数据示例省略

### 2.查询数据

输出结果如下,为了方便展示,我省略了 vector 的 value 部分

```java
import org.junit.Test;

import com.litongjava.jfinal.plugin.activerecord.Db;
import com.litongjava.jfinal.plugin.activerecord.Row;
import com.litongjava.open.chat.config.DbConfig;

public class SjsuProfessorsQueryTest {

  @Test
  public void testQuery() {
    EnvUtils.load();
    new DbConfig().config();
    int id = 3;
    Row row = Db.findById("rumi_sjsu_professors", "id", id);
    String json = JsonUtils.toJson(row.toMap());
    System.out.println(json);
  }

}

```

```json

  "id": 3,
  "name": "Dr. Emily Zhang",
  "department": "Physics",
  "job_title": "Associate Professor",
  "email": "ezhang@sjsu.edu",
  "description": "Researcher in quantum mechanics and particle physics.",
  "remark": "Emerging scientist",
  "name_vector": [],

  },

  "updater": "",
  "update_time": "2024-07-03 23:29:44",
  "deleted": 0,
  "tenant_id": 0
}
```

### 3. Java 向量查询

在 Java 中使用余弦相似度进行查询，并将输入向量传递给 SQL 查询.

1. **确保 PostgreSQL 数据库已配置好 pgvector 扩展：**

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
```

2. **创建包含向量的表：**

```sql
CREATE TABLE vector_test (
   id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
   name TEXT,
   embedding VECTOR(1536)
);
```

3. **在 Java 中构建查询并传递向量参数：**

可以使用 `PreparedStatement` 来构建和执行查询。以下是一个示例代码，展示如何将向量传递给 SQL 查询并执行查询。

```java
package com.litongjava.open.chat.model;

import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.PreparedStatement;
import java.sql.ResultSet;
import java.sql.SQLException;
import java.util.Arrays;

import com.litongjava.open.chat.config.DbConfig;
import com.litongjava.openai.client.OpenAiClient;
import com.litongjava.openai.consts.OpenAiModels;
import com.litongjava.openai.embedding.EmbeddingRequestVo;
import com.litongjava.openai.embedding.EmbeddingResponseVo;
import com.litongjava.tio.utils.dsn.DbDSNParser;
import com.litongjava.tio.utils.dsn.JdbcInfo;
import com.litongjava.tio.utils.environment.EnvUtils;

public class VectorSearchTest {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws SQLException {
    // 示例输入
    EnvUtils.load();
    new DbConfig().config();
    String question = "Jane Smith";
    EmbeddingRequestVo reoVo = new EmbeddingRequestVo(question, OpenAiModels.text_embedding_3_small);
    EmbeddingResponseVo respVo = OpenAiClient.embeddings(reoVo);
    Float[] embedding = respVo.getData().get(0).getEmbedding();

    // 转换嵌入向量为 SQL 可用的字符串
    String vectorString = Arrays.toString(embedding);

    String dsn = EnvUtils.get("DATABASE_DSN");

    JdbcInfo jdbc = new DbDSNParser().parse(dsn);

    // PostgreSQL 连接配置
    String url = jdbc.getUrl();
    String user = jdbc.getUser();
    String password = jdbc.getPswd();

    // SQL 查询
    String sql = "SELECT * FROM vector_test ORDER BY embedding <=> ? LIMIT 10";

    try (Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password);
        PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql)) {

      // 设置向量参数
      pstmt.setObject(1, vectorString, java.sql.Types.OTHER);

      // 执行查询
      try (ResultSet rs = pstmt.executeQuery()) {
        while (rs.next()) {
          // 处理查询结果
          int id = rs.getInt("id");
          String name = rs.getString("name");
          // 继续处理其他字段
          System.out.println("ID: " + id + ", Name: " + name);
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

```

**解释**：

1. **获取嵌入向量：**

   - 调用 `OpenAiClient.embeddings` 函数来获取输入问题的嵌入向量。

2. **转换嵌入向量：**

   - 将 Java 中的数组转换为 PostgreSQL 可用的 `[]` 格式字符串。

3. **建立数据库连接和执行查询：**
   - 使用 `DriverManager` 来建立数据库连接。
   - 使用 `PreparedStatement` 来构建和执行查询，并传递向量参数。
   - 处理查询结果。

### 4. 使用 Db 工具类进行向量查询

```java
package com.litongjava.open.chat.model;

import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

import org.junit.Test;

import com.litongjava.jfinal.plugin.activerecord.Db;
import com.litongjava.jfinal.plugin.activerecord.Row;
import com.litongjava.jfinal.plugin.template.SqlTemplates;
import com.litongjava.open.chat.config.SqlTplsConfig;
import com.litongjava.open.chat.config.DbConfig;
import com.litongjava.openai.client.OpenAiClient;
import com.litongjava.openai.consts.OpenAiModels;
import com.litongjava.openai.embedding.EmbeddingRequestVo;
import com.litongjava.openai.embedding.EmbeddingResponseVo;
import com.litongjava.tio.utils.environment.EnvUtils;
import com.litongjava.tio.utils.json.JsonUtils;

public class SjsuProfessorsSearchTest {

  @Test
  public void searchTest() {
    EnvUtils.load();
    new DbConfig().config();
    new SqlTplsConfig().config();
    String question = "Jane Smith";
    EmbeddingRequestVo reoVo = new EmbeddingRequestVo(question, OpenAiModels.text_embedding_3_small);
    EmbeddingResponseVo respVo = OpenAiClient.embeddings(reoVo);
    Float[] embedding = respVo.getData().get(0).getEmbedding();
    String string = Arrays.toString(embedding);

    String sql = SqlTemplates.get("professor.vector_search");

    List<Row> records = Db.find(sql, string, string, string, string, string, string);
    String json = JsonUtils.toJson(records);
    System.out.println(json);
  }
}
```

String sql = SqlTemplates.get("professor.vector_search"); 返回的 sql 语句如下

```
SELECT
  id,
  name,
  department,
  job_title,
  email,
  description,
  remark,
  (1-(name_vector <=> ?)) AS name_similarity,
  (1-(description_vector <=> ?)) AS description_similarity,
  (1-(remark_vector <=> ?)) AS remark_similarity
FROM
  rumi_sjsu_professors
ORDER BY
  GREATEST(
    1-(name_vector <=> ?),
    1-(description_vector <=> ?),
    1-(remark_vector <=> ?)
  ) DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

### 5. 合并查询参数

在上面的示例中 6 个查询参数都是相同的,能否合并为一个查询参数

```sql
SELECT
  id,
  name,
  department,
  job_title,
  email,
  description,
  remark,
  (1-(name_vector <=> ?)) AS name_similarity,
  (1-(description_vector <=> ?)) AS description_similarity,
  (1-(remark_vector <=> ?)) AS remark_similarity
FROM
  rumi_sjsu_professors,
  LATERAL (
    VALUES (
      ?::VECTOR(1536)
    )
  ) AS input(input_vector)
ORDER BY
  GREATEST(
    1-(name_vector <=> ?),
    1-(description_vector <=> ?),
    1-(remark_vector <=> ?)
  ) DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

查询时只用传入一个参数

```java
List<Row> records = Db.find(sql, string);
```

SQL 语句解释:
这个 SQL 语句是在进行向量相似度搜索。它从 rumi_sjsu_professors 表中选择数据,并计算输入向量与表中存储的向量之间的相似度。

- 选择字段包括 id, name, department, job_title, email, description, remark。
- 计算输入向量与 name_vector, description_vector, remark_vector 的相似度。
- 使用 LATERAL 子句创建一个临时的输入向量。
- 按最大相似度降序排序。
- 限制返回前 3 条结果。

<==> 运算符:

- <==> 是 PostgreSQL 中用于计算向量距离的运算符。它返回两个向量之间的余弦距离。值越小表示向量越相似。
- 1 - 余弦距离,得到的是余弦相似度

### 6. db 工具类存储向量 和 查询向量示例

```sql
CREATE TABLE rumi_embedding (id bigint PRIMARY KEY,t text, v vector(1536));
```

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

import org.junit.Test;
import org.postgresql.util.PGobject;

import com.litongjava.data.utils.SnowflakeIdUtils;
import com.litongjava.jfinal.plugin.activerecord.Db;
import com.litongjava.jfinal.plugin.activerecord.Row;
import com.litongjava.jfinal.plugin.utils.PgVectorUtils;
import com.litongjava.open.chat.config.DbConfig;
import com.litongjava.openai.client.OpenAiClient;
import com.litongjava.tio.utils.environment.EnvUtils;
import com.litongjava.tio.utils.json.JsonUtils;

public class VectorTest {

  @Test
  public void testSave() {
    EnvUtils.load();
    new DbConfig().config();
    long id = SnowflakeIdUtils.id();

    String name = "Dr. John Doe";
    Float[] embeddingArray = OpenAiClient.embeddingArray(name);
    PGobject pgVector = PgVectorUtils.getPgVector(Arrays.toString(embeddingArray));
    Row row = new Row().set("t", name).set("v", pgVector).set("id", id).setTableName("rumi_embedding");
    Db.save(row);
  }

  @Test
  public void testQuery() {
    EnvUtils.load();
    new DbConfig().config();
    String sql = "select * from rumi_embedding";
    List<Row> records = Db.find(sql);
    List<Map<String, Object>> collect = records.stream().map((e) -> e.toMap()).collect(Collectors.toList());
    String json = JsonUtils.toJson(collect);
    System.out.println(json);
  }
}
```

output
