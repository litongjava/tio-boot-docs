## Frontend Interview Task
Edge Saved – Article Bookmarking App
Time Limit
1 hour
Goal
Build a small server-side rendered web application using Cloudflare Workers and React Router (v7).
The app allows users to bookmark articles, with bookmark state rendered via SSR and persisted using signed cookies.

---
Functional Requirements
1. Routes & Pages (SSR required)
GET / — Article List Page
- Display a list of articles (hard-coded data is fine, ~10 items).
- Each article shows:
  - Title
  - Short description
  - A Bookmark / Unbookmark button
- At the top of the page, show:
- “Bookmarked: X articles”
SSR requirement
On first load, bookmark status must be rendered on the server using data from cookies (not client-only state).

---
GET /saved — Bookmarked Articles Page
- Display only bookmarked articles.
- If there are no bookmarked articles:
  - Show an empty-state message
  - Provide a link back to /

---
2. Bookmark Toggle (Action)
POST /toggle (or equivalent action)
- Receives an articleId
- Reads current bookmarks from cookies
- Toggles bookmark state
- Writes updated state back via Set-Cookie
- Returns:
  - Minimum: a redirect back to the previous page
  - Optional (bonus): use useFetcher() for a no-reload toggle

---
3. Signed Cookie (Required)
Bookmark state must be protected against tampering.
- Store bookmark data in a cookie payload, e.g.:
- { "ids": ["a1", "a3"], "iat": 1700000000 }
- Sign the payload using HMAC-SHA256
- Cookie format example:
- base64(payload).base64(signature)
- Use an environment secret:
- APP_SECRET
Important
- Use Cloudflare Workers Web Crypto API (crypto.subtle)
- Do not use Node.js crypto
- If signature verification fails:
  - Treat the cookie as invalid (empty bookmarks or clear cookie)

---
4. Headers & SSR Behavior
- All loaders/actions must run on the server (Workers runtime)
- Responses that depend on user cookies must include:
- Cache-Control: private, no-store
- Bookmark cookie should include reasonable attributes:
  - HttpOnly
  - Secure
  - SameSite=Lax
  - Path=/

---
5. Error Handling
- Implement at least one Error Boundary or errorElement
- Example cases:
  - Cookie parsing/signature verification failure
  - Unexpected loader/action errors
- Error UI can be minimal but should be user-friendly

---
Constraints
To keep the scope reasonable:
- ❌ No database (D1, KV, external DB not required)
- ❌ No authentication system
- ❌ No complex UI or styling
- ✅ Hard-coded article data is acceptable
- ✅ TypeScript is strongly recommended



Deliverables
1. GitHub repository URL
2. Development process documentation
3. Deployment to Cloudflare Workers
4. A demonstration video recorded by yourself after development is completed
